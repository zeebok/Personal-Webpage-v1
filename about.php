	<h1>About Me</h1>
	<p>My name is Ryan Kornheisl. I am a Computer Science graduate from <a href="http://www.clarkson.edu">Clarkson University</a> with a minor in psychology. I enjoy both areas as I love knowing how things work (computers or people) and creating things for each, hence why I became a computer scientist; I can learn how computers work and using what I know of how people think I can create better programs for them to use.</p>
	<p>My favorite kind of applications to program are interactive ones. Not only is it satisfying to be able to physically see what I created and see others reactions to it but these applications let me stretch my creativity muscles and use my bits of love for art. I hope my projects and interest in these things bring me to work in the video game industry, that's where my love and interest reside outside of schoolwork and stress.</p>
